# hello-world

### Hello, I'm Eric

I'm a full stack web developer using the MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. I graduated from Mizzou and Viking Code School. I normally spend my time tinkering on projects, on HackerRank, or trying to integrate my love of math with my passion for programming (once you start writing a class to handle prime number project euler problems the time just flies by.)

### Languages

JS - for life.
Ruby, C, C++, AS3
I also still write some Ruby, C, and a smidge of C++ (still need to take time to dive into it). 

I initially got into programming by teaching myself out of an outdated AS3 book and remember the pain it can be to find good material to help you learn programming - and how hard it is to get a sense of the lay of the land. I try to blog about some of the things that helped me along the way on my website so check it out if you're teaching yourself programming.
